                <p><a href="http://secondgriffin.appspot.com"><img src="images/secondgriffin.png" width="100" height="100" alt="Second Griffin thumbnail" /></a>Like many personal projects of mine, <a href="http://secondgriffin.appspot.com">Second Griffin Tables and Results</a>
                grew out of a need that I saw, combined with a desire to learn something new. The need was a decent league score reporting
                website; the someething new was Python on Google's App Engine. Unfortunately, the idea never took off, but building it
                was a good experience for me and a way to keep current on web development.</p>

                <p><a href="http://plusninescores.appspot.com/"><img src="images/plusnine.png" width="100" height="100" alt="Plus Nine thumbnail" /></a>Sick of never having a pen and paper while playing cards, I developed <a href="http://plusninescores.appspot.com/">Plus Nine</a>
                as an Android app so that my friends and I could always keep track of who is the better Hearts player.
                (Unfortunately, it's not me.) Trying to get some exposure on social networks, I also built
                a website so that players could share their scores on Facebook and Twitter. For example, here's one
                of <a href="http://plusninescores.appspot.com/games/2e7uqn">a game of mini golf with the family</a>.</p>

                a <a class="fancy" href="images/reportnet-full.png">new version</a>. Designed and built in Microsoft's Silverlight and ASP.NET, the website has drawn
                interest from our current clients and has potential to add value for new clients.</p>

                none of them did exactly what I want, which is to show an hourly view of future weather conditions.
                Maybe it's the mathematician in me that likes to see <a href="images/weathergraph-full-1.png" rel="wg2" class="fancy">graphs</a>, or the developer who likes to try
                something new, but using only web technologies&mdash;especially &lt;canvas&gt; and javascript&mdash;to build 
                this app was a gratifying, if ever-so-slightly profitable, project.</p>
